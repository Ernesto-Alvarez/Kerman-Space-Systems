R-2, surface to orbit LFOX tanker, recoverable

The R2 is a self launching surface to orbit tanker. It consists of two stages: a boosted lower stage, which does not reach orbit, and an upper stage, which does. The lower stage is completely recoverable. The upper stage is a self contained spacecraft capable of carrying its mission on its own. Mission avionics and systems are housed in two bays, one on top of the spacecraft another 1.25m diameter service bay near the centre of mass.

Uses

	Tanker
	Space station refuel
	Temporary fueling station

Maneuver system
The R-2 has 3 maneuvering systems. The main orbital maneuvering system is the upper stage main engine. This engine serves a dual purpose as OMS and launch engine. Propellants for the engine are taken from the mission tanks.

A small inline reaction wheel is used for attitude control. The wheel resides on the top of the lower avionics bay, and is as close to the centre of mass as possible. A secondary wheel is housed in the flight computer in the upper avionics bay. This wheel should only be used in emergencies, as it is not capable of properly controlling a fully loaded tanker.

A set of RCS jets is located at the spacecraft's centre of mass. The CoM is set up so that it is at the same point when the mission tanks are either full or empty. Proper fuel management can ensure adequate performance of the RCS, allowing precision translation with minimal unwanted rotation. The RCS should be used for precise maneuvering only (e.g. for docking) as RCS fuel supplies are limited. The system is fed by a round MP tank inside the lower avionics bay.

Power system

Power is provided by two means. The upper avionics bay has a Z-200 battery, with the computer's on board battery as a backup. These serve as a power source during launch, and for power storage.

Six OX-STAT panels are housed in the lower avionics bay, providing power generation capability. Power generation is limited, but adequate for tankering. Panels start generating power as soon as the lower payload doors are opened.

Communications

Communications are provided by two Communotron 16-S radios, mounted on the body of the spacecraft.

Control

Control is provided by an OKTO computer in the upper avionics bay in the R2-A model.

Fuel system

The fuel system supplies fuel to the main engine and is connected to a clampotron jr system used to refuel other crafts. The fuel system has four tanks, designated A, B, C and D, from top to bottom. Tanks A, B and C are FL-T400 type. Tank D is a FL-T200 tank. Tanks A and B are also designated as mission tanks. Tank D is also called the return tank.

Tanks drain from bottom to top during, to ensure the CoM is above the CoP. If launched according to specifications, the mission tanks should be full, while tanks C and D should be empty, their propellant expended during the launch. The tanker may be refuelled to capacity in orbit, without adverse effects.

Fuel can be stored in any of the tanks during main engine maneuvers. However, LFOX should be balanced as indicated by the fuel schedule below when using the RCS, to minimise unwanted attitude changes when translating. Residual torque can be nullified with the help of the reaction wheel and SAS.

When returning to Kerbin, fuel should be stowed in the return tank (tank D) to ensure proper reentry attitude. Reentry is not guaranteed if remaning fuel exceeds the return tank capacity. Expected mode of failure for overweight reentry is failure to deploy the parachute in time due to excessive speed at the lower layers of the atmosphere.
