R-2, surface to orbit LFOX tanker, recoverable

The R2 is a self launching surface to orbit tanker. It consists of two stages: a boosted lower stage, which does not reach orbit, and an upper stage, which does. The lower stage is completely recoverable. The upper stage is a self contained spacecraft capable of carrying its mission on its own. Mission avionics and systems are housed in two bays, one on top of the spacecraft another 1.25m diameter service bay near the centre of mass.

Uses

	Tanker
	Space station refuel
	Temporary fueling station

Maneuver system
The R-2 has 3 maneuvering systems. The main orbital maneuvering system is the upper stage main engine. This engine serves a dual purpose as OMS and launch engine. Propellants for the engine are taken from the mission tanks.

A small inline reaction wheel is used for attitude control. The wheel resides on the top of the lower avionics bay, and is as close to the centre of mass as possible. A secondary wheel is housed in the flight computer in the upper avionics bay. This wheel should only be used in emergencies, as it is not capable of properly controlling a fully loaded tanker.

A set of RCS jets is located at the spacecraft's centre of mass. The CoM is set up so that it is at the same point when the mission tanks are either full or empty. Proper fuel management can ensure adequate performance of the RCS, allowing precision translation with minimal unwanted rotation. The RCS should be used for precise maneuvering only (e.g. for docking) as RCS fuel supplies are limited. The system is fed by a round MP tank inside the lower avionics bay.

Power system

Power is provided by two means. The upper avionics bay has a Z-200 battery, with the computer's on board battery as a backup. These serve as a power source during launch, and for power storage.

Six OX-STAT panels are housed in the lower avionics bay, providing power generation capability. Power generation is limited, but adequate for tankering. Panels start generating power as soon as the lower payload doors are opened.
