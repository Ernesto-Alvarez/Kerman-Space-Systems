R-3 series of light carrier rockets. Completely reusable.

R designation is for cargo versions of the rocket. Cargo and avionics are stored in A2 type fairing (A1 for R3-800-R). L models use L30-400 boosters.

Rocket		Payload size		Gravity turn velocity		Turn angle
R3-800-R	1400 Kg			50 m/s				20
R3-1200-R	1900 Kg			75 m/s				15
R3-1200L-R	3000 Kg			30 m/s				30

MR types are used for manned capsules. Design is similar but capsule computer is used for control and parachutes are stored externally on the upper stage. Upper stage doubles as capsule service module. Figures below are for equatorial 100 Km circular orbits.
