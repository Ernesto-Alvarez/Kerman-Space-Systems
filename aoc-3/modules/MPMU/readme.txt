AOC-3 Monopropellant Maneuvering unit (MPMU).

AOC-3 module for long range exploration. Provides 1 km/s dV in a dockable unit.

The AOC-3 MPMU is designed with compatibility in mind. MPMU contains its set of RCS thrusters, whose location minimise torque when using the RCS for translation when docked to a AOC-3 capsule. Up to 50% of the available fuel can be used without significantly affecting RCS stability.
