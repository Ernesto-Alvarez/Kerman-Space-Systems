Relay satellites. Based on the SpaceBus 1 spacecraft bus.

Mainly used for creating a KSO relay system when using only the KSC ground station (TSC, "Telemetry and spacecraft control", with a M1103 over KSC and two M1108 120 degrees west and east).
Useful for Mun orbiting relays.

M110x: HG-5 based relay. SpaceBus 1 architecture. Final number indicates number of antennas.
M111x: Model 110x relay with JS-1 socket (for capture and refit).
M112x: RemoteTech compatible versions of model M110x. Spacebus 2D architecture. RemoteTech version of TSC satellite.
M1130: Low power omni relay. Based on modified SpaceBus 2A architecture. RemoteTech compatible.
M1131: Long range gateway satellite. Connects planetary comms net to other gateways via dish antennas. Based on M1203 satellite.

Model 1123 is great for TSC satellites at synchronous orbit with one HG-5 pointing down to kerbin, one to the next TSC satellite (received via omnis) and one to the active vessel.
Model 1122 is designed for the Mun part of a Mun-Kerbin link (with M1131 on the Kerbin side). One HG-5 pointing towards Kerbin and another towards Mun at high altitude. Omnis are not useful here. HG-5 is used because the RK-7's cone is too narrow to cover Kerbosynch orbit.
