Relay satellites. Based on the SpaceBus 1 spacecraft bus.

Mainly used for creating a KSO relay system when using only the KSC ground station (TSC, "Telemetry and spacecraft control", with a M1103 over KSC and two M1108 120 degrees west and east).
Useful for Mun orbiting relays.

M110x: HG-5 based relay. SpaceBus 1 architecture. Final number indicates number of antennas.
M111x: Model 110x relay with JS-1 socket (for capture and refit).
M112x: RemoteTech compatible versions of model M110x. Spacebus 2D architecture. RemoteTech version of TSC satellite.
M1130: Low power omni relay. Based on modified SpaceBus 2A architecture. RemoteTech compatible.
M1131: Long range gateway satellite. Connects planetary comms net to other gateways via dish antennas. Based on M1203 satellite.
