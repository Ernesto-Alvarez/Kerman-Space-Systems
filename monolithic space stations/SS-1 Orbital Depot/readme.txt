This is an all purpose service station for spacecraft in orbit. Spacecraft that are damaged or low on supplies can rendezvous with an orbital depot for emergency repairs or resupply.

Main functions
	Orbital service station
	Emergency supply depot

Depot contains the following supplies:

Electric Charge: 3215 units and high capacity solar power source
Food: 113.2 units in a TAC LS supply container
Water: 74.8 units
Oxygen: 11467 units
Spare Parts: 150 units, in the service bay
Liquid Fuel: 270 units in main tanks
Oxidizer: 330 units in main tanks
Monopropellant: 160 units in lower tank farm

EVA repair kit x 4, EVA propellant, Spare EVA jetpack included in service bay.

Docking is possible using clampotron junior, KAS JS-1 socket, KAS Winch and KAS pipe.

Controlled by a HECS computer and KR-2042 scripting unit.

Station has no living facilities and is designed as a supply depot only

Repositioning is done by towing using the underside clampotron junior interface. CoM is places to ensure proper towing if thrust is applied towards (or opposite) the underside clapotron.

Variants

Stock station core: contains fuel tanks, reduced size electrical system, basic lighting, docking, storage and HECS computer. Mod requirements: stock.

TAC station core: stock systems plus TAC LS supplies and full size electrical system. Mod requirements: TAC LS.

Full unit. Contains TAC station core plus KR-2042 kOS scripting unit, cherry light and multiple KAS adaptors (host, winch, telescopic joint and JS-1 socket). Mod requirements: TAC LS, KAS, kOS.

All stations can work with Dangit mod, supplies can be stored in service bay. RemoteTech compatible: power generation is more than sufficient for RT operation. The station is designed to be used with a combination of the following mods.

* KIS
* KAS
* kOS
* Dangit
* TAC life support
* RemoteTech
* RCS Build aid is recommended for station redesign
* NavBall Docking indicator is recommended for docking

Launching can be done on an R-4A rocket (D1 fairing) for cores without KAS hoses and winch. Full model requires the R-4B rocket (D2 fairing).
