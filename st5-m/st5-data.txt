Launched by a R3-1200B-N01N0R with a gravity turn at 50 m/s to 30 degrees, with the tug doing the final circularization burn.
Upper stage follows ballistic trajectory and auto-returns to kerbin for parachute landing.
For a tug+claw 1200B launch, stop circularization burn at a 80x69 orbit, eject upper stage and continue burning to 80x80 with the tug.
