KSP devices for everyone to use

This is my repository of KSP vessels and such. Unlike more "kerbal" types of design, the designs here are thought with reliability, simplicity and repeatability as major factors. The idea is to put a series of devices that will be fully documented and will work as indicated, provided they are used as indicated in the documentation.

Who knows if I'll achieve this, but at least I'll give it a try.
